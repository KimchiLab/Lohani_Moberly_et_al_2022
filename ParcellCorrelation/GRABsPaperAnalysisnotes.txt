M2 injection
grabsl16: mouse mostly running, either no face high/low states or vey few , remove from analysis

grab14: vehicle1: lots of running but enough face high/low states, use this
        drug1: good, use this 
        vehicle2: lots of running, there are lots of face high states but face looks wierd and may be groomin gstate 
        drug2: lots of quiescence but face looks weird and may be grooming state 


to do:
look at effect of drug on state changes (rather than sustained states)
also it seems that based on our old data, we should expect maybe a change in correlations between grabs and rcamp and for rcamp across areas potentially? both correlations should overall go down...
check systemic scopolamine data too 


To do for grabs paper next week note: 4/1/22
1) 3 session are currently on farnam doing the svd, they should be done. need to do smrx processing locally on them
2) 2 sessions form sl16 are not usable due to motion 


to do 4/11/22
1)with allen map, make individual paired plots for v1, surrounding areas and m2, m1 (done)

2) make pixelwise state map plots (tomorrow) 

3) look at correlations -plot individually for each mouse (as v1vehicle, m2vehicle, v1 drug, m2 drug) are the vehicle correlation matrices
consistent within an animal ? (do this tomorrow) 


total duration and num epochs seem comparable between drug and vehicle for all mice and mouse 4 jsut seems to have very few or no data and maybe should be excluded altogether even from V1 injection comparison 


To do:
preprocess with a minimum f0 for the ucrrent data 
preprocess the preinjection data 

do scoplamine systemic 
add fourth animal for lcomotin only analysis 


match number of locomoition epochs between vehicle and drug sessions for each animal and just use that period 


4/19/22
match number of locomotion epochs between vehicle and drug sessions and reanalyze local as well as scopolamine data?
do scopolamine data analysis
do state onset analysis for both scopolamine and local pharmacology 
fix wheel data before doing stat onset though 


cn03 and cn04 don't have enough states so may need to exclude those two 

cn03-runs a lot, so no face high/low states
cn04-barely runs, no locomoiton state but lots of face high/low 


tomororw:
get nonmatched all state epoches for each mouse and get correlations and state amplitudes and compare to matched states
looks like there is something there in the data!!

get rid of grooming outliers in face high data, noticed a lot of those 




4/20/22
notes:
reanalyzed old dual mice with the new characterizesstained amplitudes and got the same result for average plots! 
When examining individual mice graphs, not every animal shows that dramatic increase with locomotion. 2/ 6 mice do not show that pattern, so we probably just need more mice in our drug datasets 

looking through the data carefully, those state dependent heat plots really seem to depend on how much data went into the analysis 
whether it was just small amount of data or lots of data 

so i really need to match not only across states but between drug and vehicle groups for mouse 1 and 2
for mouse 3 - only analyze locomotion drug vs vehicle 
for mouse 4- only analyze face high vs low and skip locomotion - match the two states 

maybe to be succinct and make things easy, just analyze mouse 1 and mouse2 and match the number of states between drug and vehicle
ignore the indiv states one 


right now-the datathat I have -in systemicscopolamine are from two mice, grooming outliers removed,
states matched within condition but not conditions 
once we get data from all mice, figure out how to match states between conditions as well...

4/22/22
make variance plots instead of mean for sustained states 
do regression as in figure 2 for scopolamine data

4/26/22
do regression as in figure 2 for scopolamine data
make supplementary gfp/mcherry plots 
check what's up with the rcamp supplementary max negativity plot, what if we used a baseline before -2s 
for df/f , maybe the negativity is due to baseling drifting up 
make individaul correlation maps for figu


5/2/22
goal: finish gfp/mcherry hemodynamics 

5/10/22
look at mecamylamine data
do regression on local pharmacology data 

mecamylamine
grabam13: doesn't have locomotion state, so excluded from amplitudes and correlation 
slgrab01: doesn't have face low state, so excluded from amplitudes and correation 
for regression: use slgrab01 and grabam13

finish z-score/dff plots for rcamp/gfp finish making Figure S3 


5/4/222
one idea is do wheel and pc as discrete events(convolution, regression as we've done for behavior)

model of 
data=face (including on to off times) plus wheel (including on to off times) , model with ridge regression?


today 
run parcell corrleation and characterize states
plus analog regression
if you have time do digital regression as well 


5/12/22
mecamylamine sessions: remove slgrab01: face data looks weird for postdrug session s
and pre saline session 1 has wrong pupil timestamps 

what Jess suggested
make anterior posterior plots like in figure 2, does that go away with socpolamine?
do functional parcellation maybe?

goal for today: finish summarizing scopolamine data 
Run correlations with face only data to get enough face states, with all seven mice (done)
do permutation test of drug versus vehicle for face only (after the break do this) 
maybe match number of drug and vehicle ? 

For final scopolamine data: only use the following mice (remove the sessions that were done with the batch ofs copolamine I had made, a) because the emission levels are low for both of them and b) because the scopolamine drug used was from cardin lab and not the more recent one probably in Mike's lab (and the one from Mike's lab was used fro all other seesions) 
Only use the six gcamp mice with brigh emissions


5/22/22
for mecamylamine data: do not use slgrab01 because face data is weird for one sessions and pupil timestamps is wrong for another. Can use all other mice ic comparing face states only 

use only session1 for grabMecamy02 postdrug session 
later rename that second file to remove drug 


5/24/22 
scopolamine state amplitude data can be finicky
when matching across face high and face low only
only frontal areas are singifianct

when matching loc face high and face low 
nothing is significant

when including all states non matced 
everything except v1 is sgingificant 

do a final version where states aren't matched within each condition but states are matched across conditions as in loc number for drug and vehicile are the same, so is face high number for drug and vehicle the same. 


5/27/22
make a whole new supplementary figure with showing states, bar graphs (Drug versus vehicle for v1 and m2) and spearmans rank graph 

for hemodynamics figure, show signal peak plot plus backscatter data for gfp/mcherry 


goald for today: get all preliminary figures done at least 


5/31/22
left: 2 hrs of work 
tomorrow:do hemodynamics plot
meet with m and j and make the drug plot

6/14/22
question to ask: for gfp/mchery what traces do they want to see, aaveraged or raw trace and if it's raw
how to do it because it's from sessions where visual stimli 100% is interleaved with other contrasts 


7/8/2022
updating stats
figure2: need to run two way repeated measures anova state X area on face, locomotion, and pupil 

7/12/2022
outstanding issues 
figure s6: should we show all of the single variable stuff in there too? and blow up of y-axes for pupil/locomotion from figure2?
figure s5: should we should mecamylamine/scopolamine face state distribution 
some methods need to be filled in
